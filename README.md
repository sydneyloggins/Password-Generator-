# Password-Generator

## Description
This project generates a random password based on user's choice of number/type of characters. 

The motivation behind this project is to better understand how variables, loops, functions, and other JavaScript techniques can work together to create a basic application.
I built this project to practice the logic behind a specific application and bring the user story to life and understand how JavaScript can impact a webpage.
With the starter code, the user could not interact with the page, therefore the challenge solved this problem by added interactivity to the page. 
I learned how to implement JavaScript into HTML/CSS and solve the problem presented at the start of the challenge by researching JavaScript and figuring out how to create the Password Generator.
